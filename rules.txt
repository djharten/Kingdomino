You are a Lord seeking new lands to expand your Kingdom. You must explore all the lands, wheat fields, lakes, mountains in order to
spot the best plots. But be careful, as some other Lords are also coveting theses lands...

OBJECT OF THE GAME:
Connect your dominoes in order to build your kingdom in a 5x5 grid in a way to score the most prestige points.

SETUP:
Each player takes a starting tile (a square) and the castle of their color. They place the tile, face up, in front of them and
then they place the castle on it.All the dominoes are thoroughly shuffled, numbered side up, and then they are randomly  placed
in the box insert to form the draw pile of the game. Then, from the draw pile, take four dominoes and display  them next to the box,
numbered side up. These dominoes must be displayed in the ascending order (the lowest number next is always placed next to the box).
Finally, turn them on the landscape side. The starting order will be randomly selected. When all the dominoes have been chosen, 
form a new line, as you previously did, by drawing new tiles.

PLAYING THE GAME:
The playing order is determined by the positions of the kings on the dominoes line.The player, whose king, is placed on the 1st domino
of the line starts. He must take the following actions:
	
	1: Add the chosen domino to their territory according the connection rules.
	2: Choose a new domino in the new line by placing their king on it. Then, it is the turn of the player whose king is on the second
	domino to take their two actions, and so on, until the last player has taken their two actions. 

Each player will take the 1 and 2 actions twice, once for each of their kings. Then, form a new dominoes line and a new turn can start.

CONNECTION RULES:
The players must build a kingdom in a 5x5 grid (each domino is composed of two squares). In order to place down their domino, the player
must either connect it to their starting tile (the starting domino can be considered as a wild domino, any landscape can be connected to
this domino), or connect it to another domino matching at least 1 of its landscape (horizontally or vertically only).

If you can’t add a domino to your kingdom following these rules, the domino must be discarded and you will not get points for it.
All your dominoes must fit in 5x5 grid. If, due to bad planning, one or more of your dominoes could not fit, they are discarded. You will
not get points for them.

END OF THE GAME
When the last dominoes are lined up, the players will take a last turn but they will only take the 1 action. Each player should have in front
of them a 5x5 grid forming their kingdom. (Some kingdoms may not be complete if a player was forced to discard any dominoes – see above).
Then, each player will calculate their prestige points for their kingdoms in the following way:

	- A kingdom is composed of different PROPERTIES (groups of connected, either horizontally or vertically, squares of the same type of landscape).
	- Each property will give you as much prestige points as the NUMBER OF SQUARES multiplied with the NUMBER OF SPECIFIC CROWNS appearing on the property.
	- You can have multiple properties with the same type of landscape in the same kingdom.
	- A property without a specific crowns will give you no points.
	- Each player will add the points given by all their properties, the result is their final score.
	- In case of a tie, the player with the most extended property wins the game
	- If it is still a tie, the player who has the most crowns wins the game. If it is still a tie the players share the victory.
	
You are now ready to play!
